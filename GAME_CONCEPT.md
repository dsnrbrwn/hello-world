# 2D Death Game Simulator - Game Concept

## Core Vision
A 2D survival simulation inspired by Oregon Trail, but with a darker, more lethal twist. Players must navigate a hostile environment where death lurks around every corner and resources are scarce.

## Key Features

### Death Game Elements
- **Survival Competition**: Multiple NPCs/players competing for limited resources
- **Environmental Hazards**: Deadly weather, terrain, and random events
- **Resource Scarcity**: Food, water, medicine, and weapons are extremely limited
- **Moral Choices**: Players must make difficult decisions that affect survival chances
- **Permadeath**: When you die, you're truly dead - no respawning

### Core Mechanics
1. **Resource Management**
   - Food (prevents starvation)
   - Water (prevents dehydration)
   - Medicine (heals injuries/sickness)
   - Weapons/Tools (for hunting and defense)
   - Fuel (for vehicles/heat)

2. **Health System**
   - Health points
   - Disease/injury states
   - Fatigue/exhaustion
   - Morale/sanity

3. **Environmental Challenges**
   - Weather systems (storms, extreme temperatures)
   - Terrain obstacles (rivers, mountains, deserts)
   - Wildlife encounters (hostile animals)
   - Bandits/hostile survivors

4. **Decision Events**
   - Random encounters requiring tough choices
   - Trade opportunities with other survivors
   - Moral dilemmas (help others vs. self-preservation)

## Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Python with Pygame
- **View**: Top-down 2D perspective
- **Graphics**: Pixel art style
- **Controls**: Mouse and keyboard
- **Save System**: Permadeath with session tracking

## Game Flow
1. **Character Creation**: Choose starting resources and skills
2. **Journey**: Navigate through dangerous territories
3. **Survival**: Manage resources while facing constant threats
4. **Encounters**: Make decisions that affect survival chances
5. **Death**: Track causes of death and survival statistics

## Victory Conditions
- Reach the safe haven destination
- Survive for X number of days
- Outlast all other survivors

## Next Steps
1. Create basic game engine and window
2. Implement basic player movement and map
3. Add resource management system
4. Create event system for encounters
5. Add graphics and polish
